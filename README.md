## Vite + Vue3 + Vue Router 4 + TS + TailwindCSS + Pinia + Axios + Prettier

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. It comes with Vue Router, Pinia and TailwindCSS already installed with example code for each.

## Recommended IDE Setup:

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Try it out!

I recommend using [`degit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit) to clone the repository from Github. If you don't already have `degit` installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g degit
```

### Clone the template:

```bash
npx degit benjaminkent/vite-blazer my-new-project-name
```

### Go to prject and install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-new-project-name
```

```bash
npm i
```

### Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Create production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

And see newly created /dist folder with built assets.

### Initiate project as git repository

```bash
git init
```

Follow instructions from git for adding remote url and pushing to your own repository.
